# API configuration is now handled by client/src/utils/api.config.js
# It auto-detects:
# - Development: http://localhost:5001
# - Production: https://hrms.sandjglobaltech.com (or http:// based on current page protocol)
# 
# Only set VITE_API_URL below if you need to override the auto-detection
# Example: VITE_API_URL=https://custom-api.example.com
